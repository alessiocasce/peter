[Stewie]
Peter, I gotta ask.
You’re overweight, your fashion sense is criminal, and you once farted during a funeral speech…
Yet women like you.
How?

[Peter]
Heh… That’s ‘cause I don’t rely on looks, Stewie. I rely on strategy.
What I use is called Strategic Rizzology.

[Stewie]
That’s not even a real word.

[Peter]
Exactly. That’s Law #1: Be a mystery.
Most guys overshare. They try to prove themselves in the first 30 seconds.
But the second she feels like she knows everything about you — it’s over.
Mystery makes her curious. Curiosity keeps her around.

[Stewie]
Alright… leave some blanks. Let her fill in the story.

[Peter]
Exactly. Now Law #2: Mirror her vibe.
People like people who feel familiar. So if she’s calm, don’t be all hyper.
If she’s playful, meet that energy — don’t outdo it.
It’s about subtle syncing. She starts to feel safe, without even knowing why.

[Stewie]
Huh… So it’s not about acting, it’s about alignment.

[Peter]
Boom. You’re catching on. Now Law #3: Create moments.
You don’t need the perfect pickup line — you need a moment she’ll remember.
That could be a look, a pause, a joke that hits different.
People forget words. They don’t forget how you made them feel.

[Stewie]
…You actually read The Art of Seduction, didn’t you?

[Peter]
Heh… front to back. Highlighted the juicy parts. Took notes. Ate Doritos.
I may act dumb — but my rizz is calculated, Stewie.
