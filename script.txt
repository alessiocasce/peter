//Peter, how do you walk up to a girl and just start talking?
//My brain shuts down and my legs freeze.

[Peter]
Because I do not act like a delivery guy dropping off compliments.
I walk like I already know she is going to enjoy this.

[Stewie]
//So you just say something clever?

[Peter]
Words come later. The first thing she reads is your body language.
Slow steps, upright posture, eyes on her like you are calm, not chasing.
You are not hunting, you are inviting.

[Stewie]
//And then what? Just drop a line?

[Peter]
Something like: "I have had a crush on you for the last 30 seconds."
Confident. Playful. Unusual.
It tells her you are bold, and you do not take yourself too seriously.

[Stewie]
//What if she gives me a weird look?

[Peter]
Then you hold frame. You smile. You stay relaxed.
She is testing your confidence, pass the test by not flinching.

[Stewie]
//So most guys mess up before they even speak?

[Peter]
Exactly. If you walk up stiff, fidgety, looking scared...
you are already in the friendzone before you open your mouth.
But walk like you own the moment, and everything changes.

[Stewie]
So posture, eye contact, the pace... it all matters?

[Peter]
It is the message, Stewie.
The words are just the seasoning, the body is the whole damn meal.
